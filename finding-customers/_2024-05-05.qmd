This is a picture of Sister May Clarence, Whoopi Goldberg, in a nun's habit, from the movie Sister Act.

I don't want you to wear a habit, but I want you to develop a habit.

## Turn all of these efforts into a regular work habit

-   Regularity is critical
-   Choose a primary effort
    -   Secondary efforts only support your primary effort
-   Keep the time commitments manageable

::: notes
Don't adopt all of the ideas I have proposed here, but if you do adopt an idea, make a regular commitment. Don't do a flurry of activity. Pace yourself to avoid burnout. At the same time, carve out time, maybe a few hours every week where you focus exclusively on efforts to improve your visibility and to get your name out in front of people who can become your customers.

It's important to identify a primary effort. Don't spread yourself too thinly. Pick something. Let's say it is your newsletter. If that's the case, make sure that you get a plug in for your newsletter on those occasions when you find yourself giving a talk. Use social media mostly to publicize your newsletter. Include a subscription link in the signature file of your emails.

Your goal is to try to funnel all your secondary efforts toward that primary effort. 

Be sure to keep the time commitments manageable. Don't volunteer so much 
that you don't have time to do work for pay. Certainly no more than 25% of your time. A target of 10% might be better for some people.
