This is a clip from the Rom-Com, You've Got Mail, with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Although many clients will find you by email, there are other methods of communication that you should not ignore.

## Recognize that not everyone will find you by email

-   Falling out of fashion with younger generations
-   Social media
    -   LinkedIn
    -   X (Twitter)

::: notes
I love email. A day without email is a day without sunshine. Even the spam is fun. But not everyone uses email to communicate.

Many social media apps have an alternate channel for communication. I have to confess that I hate LinkedIn. It is overflowing with headhunters who have a wonderful career opportunity that just might be right for you.

But I've gotten a couple of clients through LinkedIn. They see my profile and send me a message that I have to figure out how to read and how to reply to.

I don't use Twitter, now called X, but it is also a common method to send private messages.

There may be other social media out there, anyone want to comment? I'm on Facebook a lot. The biggest time sink ever invented. But it is a lot of fun. I must say though, that I have never gotten any work in spite of all my Facebook posts.

## Accept payment from alternate sources

-   Standard for most is invoicing
-   Alternatives
    -   Paypal, Venmo

::: notes
It is not really a way to find clients, but I should mention that if you are an independent consultant, you should learn how to accept payments from alternate sources. It's not hard to figure out Paypal or Venmo, though I have to admit that sometimes I can't fit all these new technologies inside my already overstuffed cranium.
