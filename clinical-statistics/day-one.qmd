### Introduction

-   Tell us three interesting numbers about yourself
-   Examples
    -   I have travelled to eight countries outside the United States
        -   (Canada, Italy, China, France, Russia, England, Holland, and Iceland)
    -   I did not learn how to drive until I was 29 years old
    -   My highest chess rating was 1802, but I am not that good any more.

Speaker notes

I want to learn a bit about all of you, and I'm going to do this in a statistical way. Tell me three numbers about yourself. These could be something simple, like the number of children you have or something exotic like the height of the highest mountain you have climbed.

Here are three numbers about me.

### Your turn

#### A bit more about myself

-   PhD in Statistics in 1982 from the University of Iowa
-   Currently full professor
-   Part-time statistical consultant
-   Funded on 18 research grants
-   Over 100 peer-reviewed publications
-   Website with over 2,000 pages
-   Many invitations to talk at conferences

::: notes
I have a PhD in Statistics from the University of Iowa. I have always had a strong interest in the computational side of Statistics. My dissertation was 150 pages, and 100 of those pages were computer generated graphs.

I am currently a full professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City in the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics. I also do statistical consulting on a part-time basis.

I have been a prolific researcher, receiving support from 18 different grants, and writing over 100 peer-reviewed publications.

I started a website in 1998, writing about data analysis, research ethics, and evidence based medicine. I wrote about two or three pages every week and my site now has over 2,000 pages. It shows the value of persistence.

I love to talk about Statistics and have given many presentations at regional, national, and international conferences. This ranges from short 15 minute talks to day long short courses.

### Outline of the three day course

-   Day one: Numerical summaries and data visualization
-   Day two: Hypothesis testing and sampling
-   Day three: Statistical tests to compare treatment to a control and regression models

My goal: help you to become a better consumer of statistics

### Day one topics

-   Numerical summaries
    -   When should you present the mean versus the median
    -   When should you present the range versus standard deviation
    -   How should you display percentages
    -   Why should you round liberally

### Day one topics (continued)

-   Data visualization
    -   How should you display continuous data
    -   Why is the normal bell-shaped curve important
    -   How should you display categorical data
    -   How do you illustrate trends and patterns
    -   What are some common mistakes in the choice of colors

::: notes

### First great controvesy: mean versus median

-   Mean
    -   Add up all the values, divide by the sample size
    -   Example
-   Median
    -   Sort the data, choose the middle value(s)
    -   Example

### Choosing between the mean and median
    
-   When do you use the mean?
    -   When totals are important
-   When do you use the median
    -   When outliers/skewness might distort your conclusions
