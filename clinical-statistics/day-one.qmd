## Introduction

-   Tell us three interesting numbers about yourself
-   Examples
    -   I have travelled to eight countries outside the United States
        -   (Canada, Italy, China, France, Russia, England, Holland, and Iceland)
    -   I did not learn how to drive until I was 29 years old
    -   My highest chess rating was 1802, but I am not that good any more.

I want to learn a bit about all of you, and I'm going to do this in a statistical way. Tell me three numbers about yourself. These could be something simple, like the number of children you have or something exotic like the height of the highest mountain you have climbed.

Here are three numbers about me.
:::

## Your turn

## A bit more about myself

-   PhD in Statistics in 1982 from the University of Iowa
-   Currently full professor
-   Part-time statistical consultant
-   Funded on 18 research grants
-   Over 100 peer-reviewed publications
-   Website with over 2,000 pages
-   Many invitations to talk at conferences

::: notes
I have a PhD in Statistics from the University of Iowa. I have always had a strong interest in the computational side of Statistics. My dissertation was 150 pages, and 100 of those pages were computer generated graphs.

I am currently a full professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City in the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics. I also do statistical consulting on a part-time basis.

I have been a prolific researcher, receiving support from 18 different grants, and writing over 100 peer-reviewed publications.

I started a website in 1998, writing about data analysis, research ethics, and evidence based medicine. I wrote about two or three pages every week and my site now has over 2,000 pages. It shows the value of persistence.

I love to talk about Statistics and have given many presentations at regional, national, and international conferences. This ranges from short 15 minute talks to day long short courses.

## Outline of the three day course

-   Day one: Numerical summaries and data visualization
-   Day two: Hypothesis testing and sampling
-   Day three: Statistical tests to compare treatment to a control and regression models

My goal: help you to become a better consumer of statistics

## Day one topics

-   Numerical summaries
    -   When should you present the mean versus the median
    -   When should you present the range versus standard deviation
    -   How should you display percentages
    -   Why should you round liberally

::: notes
Speaker notes

## Day one topics (continued)

-   Data visualization
    -   How should you display continuous data
    -   Why is the normal bell-shaped curve important
    -   How should you display categorical data
    -   How do you illustrate trends and patterns
    -   What are some common mistakes in the choice of colors

::: notes
Speaker notes
:::

## First great controvesy: mean versus median

-   Mean
    -   Add up all the values, divide by the sample size
    -   Example
-   Median
    -   Sort the data, choose the middle value(s)
    -   Example

## Before mean = `r round(mean_0, 1)`

`r adds_0` = `r sum_0`

`r sum_0` / 8 = `r mean_0`
```

## After mean = `r round(mean_1, 1)`

```         
`r adds_1` = `r sum_1`

`r sum_1` / 8 = `r mean_1`
```

## Before median = `r median(bacteria_0)`

## After median = `r median(bacteria_1)`

```         
`r sort_1`

## Choosing between the mean and median

```{r}
# Testing
```

-   When do you use the mean?
    -   When totals are important
-   When do you use the median
    -   When outliers/skewness might distort your conclusions
-   Often, either is fine

## Gould 1985

Speaker notes

Stephn Jay Gould was a famous Evolutionary Biologist. He was a prolific writer with 20 books and 300 essays. Much of his writing was for academic researchers, but just as much was for the general public.

One of his most famous essays was "The Median Isn't the Message". The title is a take-off of a quote by Marshall McLuhan, "The medium is the message" which itself has an interesting history that you should investigate on your own.

The Gould essay was written in 1985 for Discover Magazine. It has been reprinted many times, and you can easily find the full text with a simple Google search.

## Bridge 2001, PMID: 11405531 (continued)

The measurement of airway resistance by the interrupter technique (Rint) needs standardization. Should measurements be made be during the expiratory or inspiratory phase of tidal breathing? **In reported studies, the measurement of Rint has been calculated as the median or mean of a small number of values, is there an important difference?**

## Bridge 2001, PMID: 11405531 (continued)

In the present data the mean of a set of values contributing to a measurement was not significantly different from the median. **However, the use of the median has been recommended since it is less affected by possible outlying values such as might be included by fully automated equipment.**

## Chen 2019, PMID: 31806195 (continued)

Background: The prices of newly approved cancer drugs have risen over the past decades. **A key policy question is whether the clinical gains offered by these drugs in treating specific cancer indications justify the price increases.**

::: {.notes}
Speaker notes
:::

## Chen 2019, PMID: 31806195 (continued)

Results: We found that between 1995 and 2012, price increases outstripped median survival gains, a finding consistent with previous literature. **Nevertheless, price per mean life-year gained increased at a considerably slower rate, suggesting that new drugs have been more effective in achieving longer-term survival.** Between 2013 and 2017, price increases reflected equally large gains in median and mean survival, resulting in a flat profile for benefit-adjusted launch prices in recent years.
