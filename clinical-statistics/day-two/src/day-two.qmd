## Re-introduce yourself

Here's one more interesting number about myself

-   51: I started running when I was 51.

Tell us one more interesting number about yourself.

::: notes
I had adopted a young boy from Russia a few years earlier and I could not keep up with him. A game of tag would leave me winded after only a few minutes. So I started running every other day. I was not very fast, but I built up endurance, so I could run for almost an hour without needing to take a break.

Lately, I have been a bit too busy, but I still try to run in organized races. Mostly 5 kilometer races, but I have done a few 10 kilometer races. I am not quite up to running a half marathon yet, but it is on my list of things to do before I die.

## Outline of the three day course

-   Day one: Numerical summaries and data visualization
-   Day two: Hypothesis testing and sampling
-   Day three: Statistical tests to compare treatment to a control and regression models

My goal: help you to become a better consumer of statistics

::: notes
Just a reminder of where you are. Day one, you learned about numerical summaries and data visualization. Today, you will see information about hypothesis testing and sampling.
:::

## Day two topics

-   Hypothesis testing
    -   What does a p-value tell you
    -   Why you might prefer a confidence interval
    -   What sample size do you need
    -   How does a Bayesian data analysis differ
    -   What should you do if you do not have a hypothesis to test

::: notes
Here are more details about what you will see on hypothesis testing...
:::

## Day two topics (continued)

-   Sampling
    -   What do you gain with a random sample
    -   When might you prefer a non-random sample
    -   When should you use randomization or blinding
    -   What are the benefits of matching
    -   How can you ensure that your sampling approach is ethical

::: notes
...and what you will see on sampling.

## Bad quiz question

A research paper computes a p-value of 0.45. How would you interpret this p-value?

1.  Strong evidence for the null hypothesis
2.  Strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis
3.  Little or no evidence for the null hypothesis
4.  Little or no evidence for the alternative hypothesis
5.  More than one answer above is correct.
6.  I do not know the answer.

::: notes
Here's a quiz question that I proposed in an earlier presentation on p-values and confidence intervals. I wrote the responses without thinking, but then realized

"This is an easy mistake to make."

and kept using this question. None of the answers listed above are correct, and you will see why in just a little bit.
:::

## A bad confidence interval

A research paper computes a confidence interval for a relative risk of 0.82 to 3.94. This confidence interval tells that the result is 

1.  statistically significant and clinically important.
2.  not statistically significant, but is clinically important.
3.  statistically significant, but not clinically important.
4.  not statistically significant, and not clinically important.
5.  The result is ambiguous.
6.  I do not know the answer.

::: notes
Here's another question. It's actually a good question about a bad confidence interval. If you learn nothing else today, but you understand why this is a bad confidence interval, you will have learned a lot.

By the way, the calculation of this hypothetical confidence interval is fine. It is what this confidence interval says about the researcher that matters.
:::

## Bayesian question

A Bayesian data analysis can incorporate subjective opinions through the use of

1.  data shrinkage.
2.  a prior distribution.
3.  a posterior distribution.
4.  p-values.
5.  I do not know the answer.

::: notes
Here's a good question. Try to answer it. If you do not know the answer, it's okay to say 5.
:::

## Sampling question

A random sample is one where

1.  everyone in the population has the same chance of selection
2.  selection is done haphazardly
3.  treatment assignment is determined by a coin flip
4.  I do not know the answer

::: notes
One more question. It's okay to select #4.
:::

## P-values

-   Most commonly reported statistic
    -   Also sharply criticized
    -   Requires a research hypothesis
-   Two alternatives
    -   Confidence intervals
    -   Bayesian analysis
-   What to do when no research hypothesis

::: notes
P-values are a fundamental tools used in most research papers, but they are coming under increasing attack in the research community. P-values are an inferential tool and require a research hypothesis. Two alternatives are confidence intervals and Bayesian data analysis.

Much research is not inferential and does not have a formal research hypothesis. It is a mistake to force these studies into a hypothesis testing framework. I will cover what you should do when you do not have a formal research hypothesis.

First, you need to remember some basic definitions from your Statistics 101 class.
:::

## What is a population?

-   Population: a group that you wish to generalize your research results to. it is defined in terms of
    -   Demography,
    -   Geography,
    -   Occupation,
    -   Time,
    -   Care requirements,
    -   Diagnosis,
    -   Or some combination of the above.

::: notes
A population is a group that you have an interest in. You want to get a better understanding of this group, so you conduct a research study and wish to generalize the results of that study to the population.

In clinical research, a population is almost always a group of people. There are a few exceptions. Sometimes you want to characterize inanimate objects, such as a group of hospitals or a group of medical devices. But let's keep the focus on people for now.

A population of people is defined in terms of certain characteristics. Usually it is a combination of these characteristics.
:::

## Example of a population

All infants born in the state of Missouri during the 1995 calendar year who have one or more visits to the Emergency room during their first year of life.

::: notes
Here is an example of a population. It has many of the characteristics described on the previous slide: demography (infants), geography (born in Missouri), time (born in calendar year 1995, during first year of life) and care requirements (one or more ER visits).

Most times the population is so large that it is difficult to get data on all the individuals of that population.

Here, we actually did have access to the data on all 29,637 infants, but most times you would not be so fortunate.
:::

## What is a sample?

-   Sample: subset of a population.
-   Random sample: every person has the same probability of being in the sample.
-   Biased sample: Some people have a decreased probability of being in the sample.
    -   Always ask "who was left out?"

::: notes
A sample is a subset of a population. Because that population of infants was so large, you decided to collect data on a smaller group, a sample of 100 infants, say.

Statistics, according to one definition is the use of data from samples to make inferences about populations. That may be a bit too narrow a definition, but it does characterize quite a bit of what we statisticians do.

A random sample is a special type of sample. It is chosen in a way to insure that every person in the sample has the same probability of being in the sample.

In contrast a biased sample is one where some people in the population have a decreased chance of being in the sample. Often in a biased sample some people in the population are totally excluded.
:::

## An example of a biased sample

-   A researcher wants to characterize **illicit drug use in teenagers.** She distributes a questionnaire to students attending a local public high school
   -   (in the U.S. high school is grades 9-12, which is mostly students from ages 14 to 18.)
-   Explain how this sample is biased.
-   Who has a decreased or even zero probability of being selected.

*Type your ideas in the chat box.*

::: notes
Here is a scenario where a researcher selects a biased sample. I should note here that this is an example specific to the United States. In Italy, you might talk about a survey distributed to the scuola secondaria di secondo grado.

STOP AND GET STUDENT RESPONSES

There are a variety of responses here. The sample does not include home schooled students, students in private schools, students with chronic diseases that force frequent school absences, and students who have dropped out.
:::

## Fixing a biased sample

-   Redfine your population
    -   Not all teenagers,
        -   but those attending public high schools.

## What is a parameter?

-   A parameter is a number computed from a sample.
    -   Examples
        -   Average health care cost associated with the 29,637 child with one or more ER visits.
        -   Proportion of these 29,637 children who died in their first year of life.
    -   Usually unknown
    -   Designated by Greek letters ($\mu$, $\pi$, $rho$)

## What is the null hypothesis?

-   The null hypothesis ($H_0$) is a statement about a parameter. 
-   It implies no difference, no change, or no relationship.
    -   Examples
        -   $H_1:\ \mu_1 - \mu_2 \ne 0$
        -   $H_0:\ \pi_1 - \pi_2 \ne 0$
        -   $H_0:\ \rho \ne 0$

:::

## What is the alternative hypothesis?

-   The alternative hypothesis ($H_1$ or $H_a$) implies a difference, change, or relationship.
    -   Examples
        -   $H_1:\ \mu_1 - \mu_2 \ne 0$
        -   $H_1:\ \pi_1 - \pi_2 \ne 0$
        -   $H_1:\ \rho \ne 0$

## Hypothesis in English instead of Greek

-   Only statisticians like Greek letters
    -   Translate to simple text
    -   For two group comparisons
        -   Safer, more effective
    -   For regression models
        -   Trend, association
  
::: notes
As a researcher, you should always think about your hypothesis in terms of population parameters, but your writing should use text. Translate the Greek letters to English.

If you have a hypothesis that compares two groups, look for comparative words like "safer" or "more effective". If your hypothesis involves some type of regression model, you should consider terms like "trend" or "association".
:::

## Example of text hypotheses (1 of 1)

-   "... the objective of this 78-week randomised, placebo-controlled study was to determine whether treatment with nilvadipine sustained-release 8 mg, once a day, was effective and safe in slowing the rate of cognitive decline in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease."
    -   Lawlor B, Segurado R, Kennelly S, et al. Nilvadipine in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease: A randomised controlled trial. PLoS Med. 2018; 15(9): e1002660. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002660
  
::: notes
Here's an example of a two group comparison. One group gets nilvadipine and the other group gets a placebo. Safety was measured as the proportion of patients who experienced an adverse event. The researchers also measured the proportion of patients who experienced a serious adverse event. So the Greek hypothesis would involve pi's. 

Effectiveness was measured using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale-12 and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes. Both of these outcome measurements are continuous, so the Greek hypothesis would involve mu's.
:::

## Example of text hypotheses (2 of 2)

-   "... we investigated trends in BCC incidence over a span of 20 years and the associations between incident BCC and risk factors in a total population of 140,171 participants from 2 large US-based cohort studies: women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; 1986–2006) and men in the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study (HPFS; 1988–2006)."
    -   Wu S, Han J, Li WQ, Li T, Qureshi AA. Basal-cell carcinoma incidence and associated risk factors in U.S. women and men. Am J Epidemiol. 2013; 178(6): 890–897. DOI: 10.1093/aje/kwt073
  
::: notes
This study used a regression model, a Cox regression model, to study trends and associations, so the Greek hypotheses would involve beta's.
:::

## Use PICO

-   P = patient population
-   I = intervention
-   C = control
-   O = outcome

## One-sided alternatives

    -   $H_1:\ \pi_1 - \pi_2 \gt 0$
    -   $H_1:\ \rho \gt 0$
-   Changes in only one direction expected
-   Changes in opposite direction uninteresting

## Passive smoking controversy

-   EPA meta-analysis of passive smoking
    -   Criticized for using a one-sided hypothesis
    -   Samet JM, Burke TA. Turning science into junk: the tobacco industry and passive smoking. Am J Public Health. 2001;91(11):1742–1744.
  
::: notes
Available in [html format](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1446866/) or [PDF format](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1446866/pdf/0911742.pdf).

Consider a study of the effects of second-hand smoke. These studies always use directional alternatives. From what we know about active cigarette smoking is that it increases the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease. So there is no reason to expect that passive smoke exposure should be any different than active smoking. Maybe it is less toxic, because of dilution and because the smoking coming off a cigarette from one end is different than the smoke coming off the cigarette from the other end. Fair enough, but there is not reason to believe that things are so different that all of a sudden the smoke becomes protective. 

Since there is no scientific basis for a protective effect of passive smoking, it makes sense to test that passive smoking has no effect versus it having an increase in bad outcomes compared to the control group. So your null hypothesis is "not harmful" and your alternative is "harmful". The beneficial hypothesis is lumped into the null hypothesis, but no one would dare claim that passive smoking was protective.

Actually, the tobacco companies did complain that the use of a directional alternative violated the norms of science. They won in a court battle in North Carolina, but lost on appeal.

As another aside, I was involved with prayer study. We planned this study using a one-sided hypothesis (remote prayer has a positive effect on health). The Institutional Review Board suggested changing this to a two-sided hypothesis (remote prayer has either a positive or a negative effect on health). Thankfully, we did not observe an outcome in the opposite tail as that would have been very difficult to explain.

## What is a decision rule? (1/3)

-   Example
        -   $H_0:\ \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$
        -   $H_1:\ \mu_1 - \mu_2 \ne 0$
        -   Accept $H_0$ if ($\bar{X}_1-\bar{X}_2$) / se is close to zero.

## What is a Type I error?

-   A Type I error is rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true
    -   (false positive).
    -   Example involving drug approval: a Type I error is allowing an ineffective drug onto the market.
-   $\alpha$ = P[Type I error]

::: notes
In your research, you specify a null hypothesis (typically labeled H0) and an alternative hypothesis (typically labeled Ha, or sometimes H1). By tradition, the null hypothesis corresponds to no change. When you are using Statistics to decide between these two hypothesis, you have to allow for the possibility of error. Actually, if you are using any other procedure, you should still allow for the possibility of error, but we statisticians are the only ones honest enough to admit this.

A Type I error is rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.

Consider a new drug that we will put on the market if we can show that it is better than a placebo. In this context, H0 would represent the hypothesis that the average improvement (or perhaps the probability of improvement) among all patients taking the new drug is equal to the average improvement (probability of improvement) among all patients taking the placebo. A Type I error would be allowing an ineffective drug onto the market.

Remember that the hypotheses involve population parameters. Population parameters are impossible to compute. So you can only talk about Type I errors in an abstract sense. You will never know for certain if you have made a Type I error.

Alpha is the probability of a Type I error, and alpha is a value that you can compute. In most studies, researchers work hard to keep the probability of a Type I error low, typically at 5%.
:::

## What is a Type II error?

-   A Type II error is accepting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.
    -   False negative result
    -   An example involving drug approval: a Type II error is keeping an effective drug off of the market.
-   $\beta$ = P[Type II error]
-   Power = $1-\beta$

::: notes

A Type II error is accepting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false. You should always remember that it is impossible to prove a negative. Some statisticians will emphasize this fact by using the phrase "fail to reject the null hypothesis" in place of "accept the null hypothesis." The former phrase always strikes me as semantic overkill. 

Many studies have small sample sizes that make it difficult to reject the null hypothesis, even when there is a big change in the data. In these situations, a Type II error might be a possible explanation for the negative study results.

Consider a new drug that we will put on the market if we can show that it is better than a placebo. In this context, H0 would represent the hypothesis that the average improvement (or perhaps the probability of improvement) among all patients taking the new drug is equal to the average improvement (probability of improvement) among all patients taking the placebo. A Type II error would be keeping an effective drug off the market.

It bears repeating that population parameters are impossible to compute. So you will never know for certain if you have made a Type I error.

Beta is the probability of a Type II error. Beta is a known quantity. Typically researchers try to keep beta small. 10% is a typical value, though in some settings, a Type II error rate as large as 20% could be tolerated.

Power is defined as 1-beta. I will talk more about power in a little bit.
:::

## What is a p-value?

-   Let t = 
    -   ($\bar{X}_1-\bar{X}_2) / se, or
    -   ($\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) / se, or  
    -   r / se 
-   p-value = Prob of seeing the sample result, t, or a result more extreme,
    -   **assuming the null hypothesis is true**

-   Small p-value, reject $H_0$
-   Large p-value, accept $H_0$

::: notes
A p-value is a measure of how much evidence we have against the null hypothesis.

The smaller the p-value, the more evidence we have against H0.

The p-value is also a measure of how likely we are to get a certain sample result or a result "more extreme," assuming H0 is true.

The type of hypothesis (right tailed, left tailed or two tailed) will determine what "more extreme" means.
:::

## Alternate interpretations

-   Consistency between the data and the null
    -   Small value, inconsistent
    -   Large value, consistent
-   Evidence against the null
    -   Small, lots of evidence against the null
    -   Large, little evidence against the null
    
::: notes
There are two interpretations that I feel are more practical. You can think of the p-value as a measure of consistency between the data and the null hypothesis. A small value implies inconsistency. It is very unlikely that you will get a value like you've seen in your sample or a value more extreme under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. So you should reject that assumption.

On the other hand if the sample results or anything more extreme has a high probability under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, then you should feel comfortable accepting that assumption.

I have argued that the p-value is a measure of evidence. Some have called it a poor measure of evidence, but I stand by my interpretation.

If the p-value is small, you have lots of evidence against the null hypothesis. If the p-value is large, you have little or no evidence against the null hypothesis.
:::

## What the p-value is not (1/2)

-   A p-value is NOT the probability that the null hypothesis is true.
    -   P[t or more extreme | null] is different than
    -   P[null | t or more extreme]
        -   P[$\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$] or
        -   P[$\pi_1 - \pi_2 = 0$] or
        -   P[$\rho = 0$] or

::: notes
The p-value is a conditional probability, and you always need to be careful about conditional probabilities. It is a probability about a sample result given an assumption about the population result. It is not a probability about a population result given the sample result. There are two reasons for this. 

First, you can't reorder a conditional probability. The probability of A given B is almost never the same as the probability of B given A. The example I give for this is the probability of being happy given that you are rich. That's a pretty high number, I hope you'll agree. There are a few rich people who lead miserable lives, but from everything I've seen, most rich people are pretty darn happy. The reverse of this is the probability of being rich given that you are happy. That number is much smaller. Because although I believe that money can buy happiness, a lot of other things can also buy happiness just as well. It's not quite as easy to find happiness if you're poor, but somehow, a lot of poor people find a way to be happy anyway.

A second reason that you can't reverse the order is that you cannot make a probability statement about population parameters. They are numbers computed from the entire population, and are fixed values. You cannot make a probability statement about something that has no sampling error.
:::

### What the p-value is not (2/2)

-   Not a measure FOR either hypothesis
    -   Little evidence **against** the null $\ne$ lots of evidence **for** the null
-   Not very informative if it is large
    -   Need a power calculation, OR
    -   Narrow confidence interval
-   Not very helpful for huge data sets

::: notes
The p-value is not a measure for either hypothesis. It is always a measure against a particular hypothesis. Now when the p-value is small, you can make a strong statement. We have lots of evidence against the null hypothesis. That translates into lots of evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

When the p-value is large, however, you are in a quandary. Little or no evidence against the null hypothesis is not the same as lots of evidence for the null hypothesis.

It's possible to have little or no evidence against the null and also have little or no evidence against the alternative. This happens whenever you have a really small sample size combined with a lot of noise.

You can't prove a negative, so the saying goes. Well, you can prove a negative, but you have to work harder at it. A large p-value by itself is not persuasive, but if you combine it with a power calculation done prior to data collection, that's pretty good evidence in support of the null hypothesis.

You could also combine a large p-value with a narrow confidence interval to support the null hypothesis. I'll talk about that more in just a bit.

In general, the p-value is not very helpful for large samples. We're seeing this more and more. Just about everything pops up as statistically significant with these huge data sets, and you can't use the p-value to separate the important stuff from the trivial stuff. You need to look instead at the magnitude of the sample estimates and calculate how much uncertainty you can remove in your future predictions.
:::

## Pop quiz, revisited

A research paper computes a p-value of 0.45. How would you interpret this p-value?

1.   Strong evidence **for** the null
2.   Strong evidence **for** the alternative
3.   Little or no evidence **for** the null
4.   Little or no evidence **for** the alternative 
5.   More than one answer above is correct.
6.   I do not know the answer.
  
::: notes
Here's that pop quiz again. Take a look at it quickly. Note that the p-value is of evidence against the null hypothesis. So each of the first four responses is wrong.

I wrote this question quickly, so shame, shame on me. But I've reproduced the example because it illustrates an important point.

![xkcd cartoon about jelly beans and cancer](../images/xkcd-jelly-beans.png){#fig-professor-mean fig-align="left"}

<div class="notes">

This cartoon is impossible to read, but you can find it on the Canvas site or in the readings. Here's a brief run down.

In the first panel, a woman runs up to a man and shouts: Jelly beans cause acne!

The man replies : Scientists! Investigate!

In the second panel, one scientist, holding a clipboard announces: We found no link between jelly beans and acne (p > 0.05).

In the third panel, the woman says: I hear it's only a certain color that causes it.

In a bunch of small panels, the scientist with a clipboard reports: We found no link between purple jelly beans and acne (p > 0.05).

We found no link between brown jelly beans and acne (p > 0.05).

We found no link between pink jelly beans and acne (p > 0.05).

The same for blue, teal, salmon, red, and so forth. And then...

We found a link between green jelly beans and acne (p < 0.05). An off-screen voice goes: Whoa!

The next six panels show

We found no link between mauve jelly beans and acne (p > 0.05).

We found no link between beige jelly beans and acne (p > 0.05).

We found no link between lilac jelly beans and acne (p > 0.05).

We found no link between black jelly beans and acne (p > 0.05).

We found no link between peach jelly beans and acne (p > 0.05).

We found no link between orange jelly beans and acne (p > 0.05).

At the bottom is a newspaper with the headline: Green Jelly Beans Linked To Acne! 95% Confidence. Only 5% chance of coincidence!

### p-hacking (2 of 2)

+ Abuse of the hypothesis testing framework.
  + Run multiple tests on the same outcome
  + Test multiple outcome measures
  + Remove outliers and retest
+ Defenses against p-hacking
  + Bonferroni
  + Primary versus secondary
  + Published protocol

<div class="notes">

This is an example of p-hacking. You change the testing process to increase the probability of a Type I error (Rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true). This increases the chance of getting a positive result, which you may find desirable, but only by increasing the probability of a false positive result.

Some examples of p-hacking. Run multiple tests on the same outcome measure. Start with the regular t-test, include the t-test that allows for unequal variances, and run two different non-parametric tests, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and the sign test. Choose the test with the smallest p-value.

You also might consider multiple outcome measures. Compare the mortality rate, the relapse rate, and the re-hospitalization rate. If any of the three is statistically significant, claim victory.

You could also do this with longitudinal data. Compare pain relief at one hour and at four hours. If you see a difference at one hour, claim that your new medication is faster acting. If you see a difference at four hours, claim that your medication is longer lasting.

You might run a test with the full data set and then with an outlier or two removed. Report for the data set that has the smaller p-value and pretend that this was your original choice all along.

These are only a few of the choices. I don't want to say more because I feel like I'm the devil tempting you.

There are two defenses against p-hacking. Well three if you count being honest. But what I mean is there are two things that you can do that will satisfy others that you are playing fairly.

First, you can adjust your decision rule by using a Bonferroni correction. Bonferroni divides alpha by the number of tests. If you are using three different outcome measures, compare your p-value of 0.0133 instead of 0.05.

Second, you can designate one of your outcome measures as primary. If you achieve statistical significance on your primary outcome, great. The remaining outcome measures are secondary. If you achieve statistical significance on a secondary outcome meausure only, report the results as provisional and requiring independent replication.

You should publish a detailed protocol, either through a clinical trial registry, or now there are journals which accept publications of the research protocols before any data are collected. It's a paper with literature review and methods section, but no results and no discussion section.

Now p-hacking has happened because some people have a skewed view of research. They are interested in using research to promote their own agenda rather than using research to uncover the truth. Perfectly understandable if you are a drug company, but you as an independent researcher should never try to skew the data. It hurts you and it hurts your patients. You need to adopt a disinterested posture in that you are glad when the research points in one direction and you are glad when it points in the opposite direction, because either way, you know more than you did before and you can treat your patients better because of this knowledge.

## What is a confidence interval?

-   Range of plausible values
    -   tries to quantify uncertainty associated with the sampling process.

::: notes
A confidence interval is a range of values that tries to quantify uncertainty associated with the sampling process.

Consider it as a range of plausible values.

There is a confidence level associated with any confidence interval, usually 95%, but sometimes 90% or 99%.

The confidence level is related to the alpha level (probability of a Type I error).

It also has a long range sampling interpretation.

If you repeatedly sampled from the same population, then 95% (or 90% or 99%) of the confidence intervals produced would contain the true value in the population.

## Why you might prefer a confidence interval

## What sample size do you need?

## Rule of 50

## Rule of 16

## Formal software for sample size calculations

## Criticisms of p-values



## What should you do if you do not have a hypothesis to test?

## Bayesian example

There's a wonderful example of Bayesian data analysis at work that is simple and fun. It's taken directly from an article by Jim Albert in the Journal of Statistics Education (1995, vol. 3 no. 3) which is available on the web at

www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v3n3/albert.html.

I want to use his second example, involving a comparison of ECMO to conventional therapy in the treatment of babies with severe respiratory failure.

In this study, 28 of 29 babies assigned to ECMO survived and 6 of 10 babies assigned to conventional therapy survived.

Refer to the Albert article for the source of the original data.

## Bayes rule

Wikipedia gives a nice general introduction to the concept of Bayesian data analysis with the following formula:

P(H\|E) = P(E\|H) P(H) / P(E)

where H represents a particular hypothesis, and E represents evidence (data). P, of course, stands for probability.

## Prior

::: notes
The first step is to specify P(H), which is called the prior probability. Specifying the prior probability is probably the one aspect of Bayesian data analysis that causes the most controversy. The prior probability represents the degree of belief that you have in a particular hypothesis prior to collection of your data.

## Subjective prior

::: notes
The prior distribution can incorporate data from previous related studies or it can incorporate subjective impressions of the researcher. What!?! you're saying right now. Aren't statistics supposed to remove the need for subjective opinions?

Actually, a bit of subjectivity is a good thing.

First, it is impossible to totally remove subjective opinion from a data analysis. You can't do research without adopting some informal rules. These rules may be reasonable, they may be supported to some extent by empirical data, but they are still applied in a largely subjective fashion.

Here are some of the subjective beliefs that I use in my work:

-   you should always prefer a simple model to a complex model if both predict the data with the same level of precision.
-   you should be cautious about any subgroup finding that was not pre-specified in the research protocol.
-   if you can find a plausible biological mechanism, that adds credibility to your results.

Second, the use of a range of prior distributions can help resolve controversies involving conflicting beliefs. For example, an important research question is whether a research finding should "close the book" to further research. If data indicates a negative result, and this result is negative even using an optimistic prior probability, then all researchers, even those with the most optimistic hopes for the therapy, should move on.

Third, while Bayesian data analysis allows you to incorporate subjective opinions into your prior probability, it does not require you to incorporate subjectivity. Many Bayesian data analyses use what it called a diffuse or non-informative prior distribution. This is a prior distribution that is neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but spreads the probability more or less evenly across all hypotheses.

## ECMO prior

::: notes
Here's a simple example of a diffuse prior that Dr. Albert used for the ECMO versus conventional therapy example. Let's assume that the true survival rate could be either 0, 10%, 20%, ..., 100% in the ECMO group and similarly for the conventional therapy group. This is not an optimal assumption, but it isn't terrible either, and it allows us to see some of the calculations in action.

With 11 probabilities for ECMO and 11 probabilities for conventional therapy, we have 121 possible combinations. How should we arrange those probabilities? One possibility is to assign half of the total probability to combinations where the probabilities are the same for ECMO and conventional therapy and the remaining half to combinations where the probabilities are different. Split each of these probabilities evenly over all the combinations.

This is P(H). For simplicity, we multiplied each probability by 1000 and rounded.

## Repeat the bad quiz question

A research paper computes a p-value of 0.45. How would you interpret this p-value?

1.  Strong evidence for the null hypothesis
2.  Strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis
3.  Little or no evidence for the null hypothesis
4.  Little or no evidence for the alternative hypothesis
5.  More than one answer above is correct.
6.  I do not know the answer.

::: notes
Here's that bad quiz question again. Why are none of these answers correct?

WAIT FOR STUDENTS TO RESPOND

Because a p-value is a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis. A large p-value means little or no evidence against the null hypothesis.
:::

## Repat the bad confidence interval question.

A research paper computes a confidence interval for a relative risk of 0.82 to 3.94. What does this confidence interval tell you.

1.  The result is statistically significant and clinically important.
2.  The result is not statistically significant, but is clinically important.
3.  The result is statistically significant, but not clinically important.
4.  The result is not statistically significant, and not clinically important.
5.  The result is ambiguous.
6.  I do not know the answer.

::: notes
What does this confidence interval say about the research?

WAIT FOR STUDENTS TO RESPOND

The result is ambiguous. You should be recoiling at this confidence interval because it cannot distinguish between no change in risk, a doubling of risk, or even a tripling of risk.
:::

## Repeat of Bayesian question

A Bayesian data analysis can incorporate subjective opinions through the use of Bayes rule.

1.  data shrinkage.
2.  a prior distribution.
3.  a posterior distribution.
4.  p-values.
5.  I do not know the answer.

::: notes
Here's a good question. See if you remember a key feature of Bayesian data analysis.
:::

## Repeat of sampling question

A random sample is one where

1.  everyone in the population has the same chance of selection
2.  selection is done haphazardly
3.  treatment assignment is determined by a coin flip
4.  I do not know the answer

::: notes
One more question, this time about sampling.
