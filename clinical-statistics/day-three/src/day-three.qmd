## Outline of the three day course

-   Day one: Numerical summaries and data visualization
-   Day two: Hypothesis testing and sampling
-   Day three: Statistical tests to compare treatment to a control and regression models

My goal: help you to become a better consumer of statistics

::: notes
We are in the third day of the class. The topics you will see today include comparisons of a treatment to a control. This is a common setting in medical research. You will also get an introduction to regression models.
:::

## Day three topics

-   Statistical tests to compare a treatment to a control
    -   What tests should you use for categorical outcomes?
    -   What tests should you use for continuous outcomes?
    -   When should you use nonparametric tests?

::: notes
The you use when comparing a treatment to a control depends on whether the outcome is continuous or categorical. You'll also get a feel for when to use nonparametric tests instead of the traditional tests.
:::

## Day three topics (continued)

-   Regression models
    -   How does a regression model quantify trends
    -   How does logistic regression differ from linear regression
    -   What is a confounding variable
    -   How should you control for or adjust for confounding

::: notes
You'll also get an introduction to regression models. I want to emphasize interpretation, both for linear regression and logistic regression. Regression models excel at identifying and controlling for confounding variables.

But first, a joke that relates to the topic of regression.

Two statisticians are on a plane flying from Amsterdam to Zurich. The flight proceeds normally, until 15 minutes go by, when they hear ...

... a loud BANG! The pilot comes on the intercom and says "Ladies and gentlemen, one of the four engines on this plan just exploded. You're all fine, but the flight that was supposed to take four hours will now take six hours. I apologize for any inconvenience." So the two statisticians shrug their shoulders and start talking again about the geeky things that statisticians like to talk about. Fifteen minutes later, they hear ...

... another loud BANG! The pilot comes on the intercom and says "Ladies and gentlemen, a second engines just exploded. You're all fine, but the flight is now going to take eight hours. I greatly apologize for any inconvenience." So the two statisticians shrug their shoulders and start talking again. You know what happens next. In fifteen minutes later, they hear ...

::: notes
... a third loud BANG! The pilot comes on the itnercom and says "Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a third engine. Now every engine on this aircraft is very powerful so you all will arrive safely in Zurich. But the flight time is now ten hours." At this point, one statistician turns to the other and says, "I hope this last engine doesn't explode..."

"...OR WE'LL BE UP HERE FOREVER!"

This story illustrates a dangerous extrapolation. It offers an important point in the use of regression models, so I will return to it later in this talk.

## Comparison of treatment and control

-   Treatment, something new that you do to a patient
    -   Intended to make things better.
    -   Active intervention
    -   Randomized trial
-   Exposure, something that a patient endures
    -   Concern that it might cause harm
    -   Passive observation
    -   Epidemiology study
-   Control
    -   Placebo, or
    -   Usual standard of care
    
::: notes
I am going to use the terms treatment and control a lot today, so you need to understand how I define these terms.

A treatment is something new that you as a researcher do to your patients. It could be a new drug, a medical device, an exercise regimen, or something else. It is intended to make things better. It might not make things better. In fact, it may at times make things worse. But the intent is important. A treatment is something that you do that you hope will make things better.

A treatment requires your active intervention. You do something different to the patient or ask them to do something different than what they might normally do. Treatments are usually evaluated in the context of a randomized trial.

In contrast, an exposure is something that a patient endures. It is thought that it might be harmful, but you're not sure. It could be a chemical exposure, such as a pesticide. It could be a dietary choice like black pudding. It could be a lifestyle choice like playing rugby. You, as a researcher, are a passive observer. You don't do something intentional to your patients or ask them to do something if you think it might be harmful. Exposures are usually examined in the context of an epidemiology study.

The control is sometimes a placebo or sometimes the usual standard of care which you want to compare to a treatment. In an exposure study, the control is the lack of an exposure.

Now there are not always easy distinctions between treatments and exposures. Is the use of CBD oil a treatment or an exposure?

Don't worry too much about the distinctions for now. The choice of what statistic to use is not influenced by whether you are studying a treatment or an exposure. The research design changes a lot, perhaps, but the same t-test that you use to compare a treatment mean to a control mean is the one you would use if you have an exposure mean instead.

## Comparison of a binary outcome

$$X^2 = \Sigma \frac{(O_{ij}-E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$$
