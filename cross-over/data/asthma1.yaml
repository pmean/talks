  From the original source: Measures of 
  peak expiratory flow made on children 
  aged 7 to 14 with moderate to severe 
  asthma in a two-treatmenttwo-period 
  cross-over comparing the effects of a 
  single inhaled dose of 200 ug 
  salbutamol, a well-estblished 
  bronchodilator and 12 ug formoterol, 
  a more recently developed bronchodilator.
  Patient 8 dropped out of the study after
  the first measurement and is not 
  included in this file.
