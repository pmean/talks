"A gentle introduction to the bootstrap"

The bootstrap is a methodology derived by Bradley Efron in the 1980s that provides a reasonable approximation to the sampling distribution of various "difficult" statistics. Difficult statistics are those where there is no mathematical theory to establish a distribution. It is also useful when you don't trust the mathematical theory because of a small sample size or potential violations of the underlying assumptions. The bootstrap is also a mechanism used by many machine learning algorithms to avoid overfitting. This talk will orient you to the general mechanisms of the bootstrap algorithm and illustrate its application in a couple of simple settings.
