# talks

This is a series of folders containing Markdown and Rmarkdown 
code that I used in a variety of papers and presentations.

I am moving the presentations from an
[old repository, papers-and-presentations][papers].

Please look in this current repository for any talks in 2023
or later.

is in the public domain. Any images that I create using
R code are also in the public domain.

You can do anything you want with any code or images that I
have created. If you do use anything, an acknowledgement
